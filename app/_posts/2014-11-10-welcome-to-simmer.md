Welcome to the Simmer website.

We hope that you feel right at home. The design is largely borrowed from the population of shiny,
modern product landing pages, because we thought the *last* thing you would want to look at would
be yet another traditional academic publication.

Although the site is still under heavy development, the modern agile software engineering workflow 
allows us to keep building and improving components iteratively while always serving up the best 
that we have right now.

In the spirit of Open Science, more than the content I'm excited to discuss the technology behind
the website, and how you can start using it yourself. [GitHub](gh) offers free hosting
for static websites through its [GitHub Pages](ghp) tool. Just `git push`
and your content is live. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a popular Ruby tool for creating such
static websites, and that's exactly what Simmer users.

You can go right ahead and browse the code powering the Simmer website on
[GitHub](https://github.com/simmer/simmer.github.io). You can even fork the repository and have your
own Simmer website in seconds, although you'll get stuck with some Simmer-specific baggage.

If you're keen to start building websites, stay tuned and we will be releasing a more generic 
framework for Simmer-like website. If you're *desperately* keen, you can follow the same path 
with [Yeoman][yo] and the associated [Jekyll generator][jg]. Be aware however that this manual 
approach requires getting your hands dirty, and we're building a layer on top of that which we'll
discuss soon.

To hear about it as soon as it goes live, and for other news about Simmer and the state of the 
art of open science technologies, become a member of the Simulati below.
