Simmer Website
==============

This is the Simmer website. It's still heavily in development, but Simmer is all about Open Science,
so we're building out in the open on a shoestring budget ($0) so you can always have the best of what we've got.

Visit us live at **http://www.runsimmer.com/**!

# Technology

The website is a static site built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the popular static site generator.
We will be talking much more about this soon on [the blog](http://www.runsimmer.com/blog/). Stay tuned!
